    <p>The dog is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct
    population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be domesticated
    by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture.</p>
